# Paya's Terrible Additions

A terrible mod that adds whatever I want to Balatro and other stuff.

Requires latest Steamodded.

![Current Content](images/mod_content.png)

## The 'Additions' in question

- Atleast 30+ new Jokers!
- New consumables, both old and new types!
- New mechanics! (If you call new currency a mechanic)
- Probably relies too much on Cryptid
- An acceptable amount of cross-mod content
- Not compatible with The Mod Formerly Known As Jen's Almanac
